Group project created for Carleton University's SYSC 3110.

The group members are: Alex Hoecht, 

The goal of this team project was to build a simulator to evaluate the performance of various routing algorithms. These algorithmsare are
used in communication networks like the internet. Within this network messages are passed between 'Routers' in a specific order, this order
is deturmined by the 'Routing Algorithim".
